    abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

    abstract = {A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb{\textasciicircum}-1 collected at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb{\textasciicircum}-1 at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H-{\textgreater}ZZ{\textasciicircum}(*)-{\textgreater}llll, H-{\textgreater}gamma gamma and H-{\textgreater}WW-{\textgreater}e nu mu nu in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H-{\textgreater}ZZ{\textasciicircum}(*), WW{\textasciicircum}(*), bbbar and tau{\textasciicircum}+tau{\textasciicircum}- in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H-{\textgreater}ZZ{\textasciicircum}(*)-{\textgreater}llll and H-{\textgreater}gamma gamma channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0 +/- 0.4(stat) +/- 0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7x10{\textasciicircum}-9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.},
